# Phase 2 – Extended Security Testing

This phase was completed as part of a group project.  
This document describes my individual contribution and learning during Phase 2.

## Work done
- Assisted in deploying the Phase 2 Docker environment.
- Verified application availability and services.
- Performed functional testing on registration, validation, and booking features.
- Conducted security testing focusing on XSS, SQL injection, CSRF, and session handling.
- Participated in OWASP ZAP automated security scans.
- Assisted with password strength testing using online tools.
- Helped update security and test documentation.

## Tools used
- OWASP ZAP
- Docker
- Manual functional testing
- Markdown documentation
- GitHub

## What I learned
Phase 2 helped me better understand how automated security testing complements manual testing.  
I also learned how vulnerabilities such as CSRF and weak password policies can be identified and analysed in a real application environment.
